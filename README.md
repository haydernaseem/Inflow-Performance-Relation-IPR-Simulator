## ðŸ“ˆ Inflow Performance Relation (IPR) Simulator

A Python-based engineering application that models and analyzes well inflow performance curves using several standard correlations, including:

- Vogelâ€™s Equation  
- Standingâ€™s Method  
- Witzkovitch Correlation  
- Cuto Method  

The simulator allows users to **plot the relationship between pressure (P) and flow rate (Q)** for different reservoir and well conditions.

### ðŸ”¹ Features:
- Supports multiple analytical models (Vogel, Standing, Witzkovitch, and Cuto)
- Provides **interactive visualization of Pâ€“Q relationships**
- Ideal for **academic research** and **quick well performance testing**
- Designed with user-friendly interface and precise numerical calculations

**Technologies:** Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, GUI (PyQt5)
